# G Smart Translator - Desktop Application

A modern desktop application for managing and automating JSON translation files using OpenAI GPT-4o. Perfect for developers and teams working with multilingual applications.

## 🚀 How to Get Started

### Request Access

This application requires an active subscription to use. To request access:

1. **Send an email** to **testingmythingzz@gmail.com** with the following information:

   - Your name
   - Your intended use case
   - Your preferred username (alphanumeric, underscores, and hyphens only)
   - Your operating system (Mac or Windows)

2. **What happens next:**
   - We'll review your request
   - If approved, we'll create your account and send you the installer file via email
   - You'll receive your username and subscription details
   - Install the app and start translating!

### System Requirements

- **macOS** 10.13 or later
- **Windows** 10 or later
- **Note:** Linux is not currently supported

## 📦 Installation

Once you receive the installer via email:

### macOS

1. **Download the ZIP file** from the email attachment
2. **Extract the ZIP file** (double-click it)
3. **Move the app to Applications folder:**
   - Drag `G Smart Translator.app` to your Applications folder
4. **Remove quarantine attribute (Required for first-time setup):**

   Open Terminal (Applications → Utilities → Terminal) and run:

   ```bash
   xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/G Smart Translator.app"
   ```

   **Note:** If you placed the app in a different location, replace `/Applications/` with the actual path. For example, if it's in your Downloads folder:

   ```bash
   xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/"G Smart Translator.app"
   ```

5. **Launch the app:**
   - Open Applications folder
   - Double-click `G Smart Translator.app`
   - The app will open normally

**Why this step is needed:** macOS adds a "quarantine" attribute to files downloaded from the internet. This is a security feature. Removing it allows the app to run without the "damaged" error message.

### Windows - **Coming Soon** (Currently in development)

1. **Download the portable EXE file** from the email attachment
2. **Run the executable:**
   - Double-click the `.exe` file
   - The app will launch (no installation needed)
3. **Optional:** Create a desktop shortcut for easy access
